# Account Abstraction in Hardhat Project

This repository implements the concept of account abstraction in a Hardhat project on the Mumbai network. It utilizes EIP 4337, an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that introduces the concept of account abstraction.

## 🔒🔑💼 Account Abstraction

Account abstraction allows for more flexibility in managing accounts and transactions on the Ethereum network. It enables developers to create custom account types and define their own transaction validation rules. This can be useful for implementing advanced features such as multi-signature wallets or smart contract wallets.

## 🛠️💡 Applying EIP 4337

By applying EIP 4337 in this Hardhat project, you can take advantage of the benefits provided by account abstraction and build more secure and efficient applications on the Mumbai network.
