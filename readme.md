    <h1>Account Abstraction in Hardhat Project</h1>
    <p>This code implements the concept of account abstraction in a Hardhat project on the Mumbai network.</p>
    <p>It utilizes EIP 4337, which is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that introduces the concept of account abstraction.</p>
    <p>🔒🔑💼</p>
    <br>
    <p>Account abstraction allows for more flexibility in managing accounts and transactions on the Ethereum network.</p>
    <p>It enables developers to create custom account types and define their own transaction validation rules.</p>
    <p>This can be useful for implementing advanced features such as multi-signature wallets or smart contract wallets.</p>
    <p>🛠️💡</p>
    <br>
    <p>By applying EIP 4337 in this Hardhat project, you can take advantage of the benefits provided by account abstraction</p>
    <p>and build more secure and efficient applications on the Mumbai network.</p>
    <p>🚀🌐</p>
