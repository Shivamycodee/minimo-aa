"""
This code implements the concept of account abstraction in a Hardhat project on the Mumbai network.
It utilizes EIP 4337, which is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that introduces the concept of account abstraction.
🔒🔑💼

Account abstraction allows for more flexibility in managing accounts and transactions on the Ethereum network.
It enables developers to create custom account types and define their own transaction validation rules.
This can be useful for implementing advanced features such as multi-signature wallets or smart contract wallets.
🛠️💡

By applying EIP 4337 in this Hardhat project, you can take advantage of the benefits provided by account abstraction
and build more secure and efficient applications on the Mumbai network.
🚀🌐

For more information about EIP 4337 and account abstraction, refer to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal documentation.
